	<string>We are living in the era where technology is widely accepted and becomes so commonplace that we doubt how we ever live without it. Mobile is a good prominent example. From businesses to individual consumers, everyone is connected to everyone, everywhere, all the time. Every day we hear of new technological breakthroughs, e.g. self-driving cars, organ-on-a-chip, smart glasses, drones; they are awe-inspiring. To remain in the game, the best IT professionals strive to maintain current knowledge and skills to take on these continual developments.  The Master of Science in Computer Science Programme is a comprehensive and challenging graduate programme with three specialisations and one general stream, namely Financial Computing Stream, Cyber Security Stream, Multimedia Computing Stream and General Computer Science Stream, to meet the needs of both industry and business in Asia, and to make the programme more unique among comparable programmes in the region.  As you can see from our curriculum, on one hand we have retained the nuts and bolts subjects to lay a strong foundation. But on the other hand, we updated and revised the curriculum continuously as we assess the career trends and needs of our students, and monitor rapid changes in technology developments. For example, hot topics like “fintech”, “blockchain” are included in some of our courses.  If you like the holistic approach of our teaching methods and curriculum, please consider enrolling in this established programme in a world-class university.  Dr. K.P. Chow Programme Director</string>

	<string>Words from Students and Graduates

When you enrol in the MSc(CompSc) Programme, you gain all the advantages of a famous university with an outstanding reputation. When you leave our Programme, you will have a solid foundation in the theoretical aspect of computer science, together with hands-on technical experience in information technology, to help you begin a rewarding career.

But a master’s programme does not have to be the last chapter of your learning merely technical, hard-core information technology; it can serve as a springboard to other career opportunities and learning challenges. For example, many of our graduates who find themselves moving into management, may continue their studies towards an MBA degree, while others may go on to doctoral studies here at HKU or elsewhere.

Some of our students and graduates would also like to share their experience with you.</string>

Join us at the information sessions, and find out if the Master of Science in Computer Science Programme is the right fit for your career goals. Information Sessions include a programme overview and Q&amp;A, plus the opportunity to talk informally with Programme Director and staff. Potential applicants are welcome.

Information sessions will be organized in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Details of these information sessions will be announced on our website and/or advertised online and in major local newspapers.

Details of the information session:</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverview1</key>
	<string>The MSc(CompSc) programme is a comprehensive postgraduate study programme provides advanced and in-depth learning in Computer Science.  The programme is credit unit based, with courses of both applied and fundamental nature.

Students can choose focussed streams of study or a comprehensive and diversified study in Computer Science, i.e. the General Stream.

Focussed streams of study represent a cohesive collection of related courses that provides both fundamental and in-depth exposure to students in a given ICT domain.  Students can extend and deepen their knowledge in the specialization streams in Cyber Security, Multimedia Computing and Financial Computing. </string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverviewCyberSecurity</key>
	<string>The Cyber Security Stream is a multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity concerned with state-of-the-art technology in cyber security. The curriculum covers different aspects of cyber security from different perspectives, including technical, organisational, human-oriented and legal.</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverviewMultimediaComputing</key>
	<string>The Multimedia Computing Stream focuses on multimedia computing, communications, analytics, visualisation and applications.

Multimedia Computing encompasses media coding and processing, streaming-media middleware, media representations, real-time protocols, media analysis, and human-interaction and visualisation techniques.

Students are encouraged to develop innovative ideas using the latest development in technology such as mobile devices and big-data analytics.</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverviewFinancialComputing</key>
	<string>The Financial Computing Stream is the study of data and algorithms used in finance and the mathematics of computer programs that realise financial models or systems.

Financial Computing emphasises practical numerical methods and focuses on techniques that are directly applicable to business and financial analysis.

The emphasis will be in the computing aspect of the financial industry.</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverviewGeneralStream</key>
	<string>The General Stream covers a broad, comprehensive range of Computer Science subjects, including a wide range of courses from which students can choose from. It offers students the most flexibility to design their own study portfolio based on their career aspiration or requirements.</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverview2</key>
	<string>Students are required to complete 72 credits of courses selected from the syllabus which must include capstone experience.</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverview3</key>
	<string>Students can study in one of the following enrolment modes:

(a)Courses (60 credits)^ + Project (12 credits)

     i.e. 10 Courses + Project

OR

(b)Courses (48 credits)^ + Dissertation (24 credits)

     i.e. 8 Courses + Dissertation

^ Each course normally carries 6 credits</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverview4</key>
	<string>Students shall select courses in accordance with the regulations of the degree. To qualify as a graduate of Cyber Security, Financial Computing, or Multimedia Computing Stream, students must pass at least 4 stream specific courses (at least 24 credits in total) in the corresponding subject group, and undertake a dissertation or a project in the area of the corresponding stream. For General Stream, students can choose any discipline courses from any subject group, and undertake a dissertation or a project in any area in computer science

Students may select no more than 2 courses (at most 12 credits in total) offered by the MSc(ECom&amp;IComp) and MSc(Eng) curricula in the Faculty of Engineering as electives.</string>
	<key>ProgrammeOverview5</key>
	<string>The capstone experience will definitely be beneficial for students to put together what they have learnt in the programme and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the knowledge they have acquired. Students are required to complete a dissertation (24 credits) or a project (12 credits), and attend some supplementary workshops. The dissertation / project would represent students’ consolidated capstone experience in their study.</string>
