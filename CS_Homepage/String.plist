	<string>We are living in the era where technology is widely accepted and becomes so commonplace that we doubt how we ever live without it. Mobile is a good prominent example. From businesses to individual consumers, everyone is connected to everyone, everywhere, all the time. Every day we hear of new technological breakthroughs, e.g. self-driving cars, organ-on-a-chip, smart glasses, drones; they are awe-inspiring. To remain in the game, the best IT professionals strive to maintain current knowledge and skills to take on these continual developments.  The Master of Science in Computer Science Programme is a comprehensive and challenging graduate programme with three specialisations and one general stream, namely Financial Computing Stream, Cyber Security Stream, Multimedia Computing Stream and General Computer Science Stream, to meet the needs of both industry and business in Asia, and to make the programme more unique among comparable programmes in the region.  As you can see from our curriculum, on one hand we have retained the nuts and bolts subjects to lay a strong foundation. But on the other hand, we updated and revised the curriculum continuously as we assess the career trends and needs of our students, and monitor rapid changes in technology developments. For example, hot topics like “fintech”, “blockchain” are included in some of our courses.  If you like the holistic approach of our teaching methods and curriculum, please consider enrolling in this established programme in a world-class university.  Dr. K.P. Chow Programme Director</string>

	<string>Composition Fees

The composition fee for each 6 credit-units in MSc(CompSc) is HK$13,000*.  The dissertation, which is equivalent to 24 credits, has a composition fee of HK$52,000*.  The total composition fees are therefore as follows:

48 credit-units (8 courses) + dissertation:
(HK$13,000* x 8) + (HK$52,000*) = HK$156,000*

Students who select to study a course from the MSc(ECom&amp;IComp) and MSc(Eng) programmes have to pay HK$13,000* and HK$12,000* respectively per 6-credit course.

* Subject to University approval

Fees for enrolled courses are paid on semester basis.  The first instalment of composition fees of 12 credit-units is payable at the time of acceptance of an offer of admission.

Generally composition fees for cancelled enrolment before specified deadline are not refunded, but can be used to pay for another enrolled course or carried over to the next semester as credit. (Subject to the approval by the University)

	<string>Words from Students and Graduates

When you enrol in the MSc(CompSc) Programme, you gain all the advantages of a famous university with an outstanding reputation. When you leave our Programme, you will have a solid foundation in the theoretical aspect of computer science, together with hands-on technical experience in information technology, to help you begin a rewarding career.

But a master’s programme does not have to be the last chapter of your learning merely technical, hard-core information technology; it can serve as a springboard to other career opportunities and learning challenges. For example, many of our graduates who find themselves moving into management, may continue their studies towards an MBA degree, while others may go on to doctoral studies here at HKU or elsewhere.

Some of our students and graduates would also like to share their experience with you.</string>
